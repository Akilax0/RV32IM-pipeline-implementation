# RV32IM-pipeline-implementation

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to design and implement a 5 stage pipeline CPU to support the RISC-V instruction architecture. This pipeline CPU supports the entire RV32IM ISA which contains 45 instructions. The designed pipeline CPU is implemented using behavioral modeling in verilogHDL and icarus Verilog is used to compile and simulate. gtkWave is used to observe the behavior.
